# Description
Why use SMS Notifications?

Simple - it is the simplest and handy channel through which you can communicate information about their orders. SMS as a communication method has an opening rate of 95% and most are read within 5 seconds of receiving them. It was found to be 3 times more productive than email and by far the easiest to customize. For example, when the order status changes to "Complete" you can include a 10% discount coupon on the next order.

All you have to do is get creative, and your sales will exceed your expectations!
